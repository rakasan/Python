 neural language models (NLMs)
 opic modeling is an area of NLP dedicated to uncovering latent, or hidden, topics within a body of language.

 Regex Expressions : 
    - "words"
    - word | another_word
    - ["leters to contain"]word to contain (ex : [chr]at - will match cat, hat,eat)
    - . ->wildcard/ pentru a compara cu "." se foloseste \. (ex: ....\. will match bear.)
    - ranges [a-c] will include a,b,c [2-9] will include the values 2,3...,9 ex:[b-e][l-u][b-k] will match cub,dog,elk but it will not match ape,cow,ewe
    - shorthand character classes : - "\w" -word character reprezents :[A-Za-z0-9_]
                                    - "\d" - digit character
                                    - "\s" - whitespace character ->[ \t\r\n\f\v], matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab
                    -> \d\s\w\w\w\w\w\w -> will match the following 5 sloths, 8 llamas
    - grouping ->(puppies|kitty cats)\sare\smy\sfavorite!
    - quantifiers ->Fixed quantifiers \w{3} - 3 characters roa{3,7}r -ro + >=3* & <=7
            ex : squea{3,5}k will match squeaaak,squeaaaak
            \d\s(duck|ducks)\sfor\sadoption\?
            Optional quantifiers ->\d\sducks?\sfor\sadoption\?
    -  Kleene star(* | *+) hoo+t | ho*t will match hot,hoot,hooooot
    [^cdh]are - > sa nu contina la inceput cdh
